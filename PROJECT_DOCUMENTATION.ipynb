    "## SEE I Paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "S – State it:\n",
    "The ongoing bus driver shortage in Sydney is significantly impacting the reliability of public transport, leading to widespread cancellations and frustration among commuters.\n",
    "\n",
    "E – Elaborate:\n",
    "This shortage has resulted in a consistent rise in service cancellations and delays across major regions in NSW. Government reports and taskforce findings reveal that the root causes include poor working conditions, an aging workforce, and insufficient recruitment efforts. These challenges are not unique to Sydney; similar patterns are observed internationally, highlighting systemic issues within the transit industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "E – Exemplify:\n",
    "For instance, the NSW Bus Industry Taskforce described the system as \"neglected and underfunded,\" while a 7News article warned commuters to \"brace for chaos\" due to hundreds of cancelled routes. Additionally, academic studies from Vietnam and the Netherlands show that long hours, stress, and a lack of flexibility drive attrition rates among bus drivers worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "I – Illustrate:\n",
    "It’s like a sports team trying to win a match with half its players injured or missing—no matter how good the strategy or schedule, without enough skilled players (in this case, drivers), the whole system struggles to perform. Similarly, until driver numbers are stabilized, transport reliability will continue to suffer."

    "## Analyse and Conclude\n",
    "\n",
    "S (State it):\n",
    "Public complaints are a strong indicator of gaps in transport reliability, especially in areas like cancelled services and driver shortages.\n",
    "\n",
    "E (Elaborate):\n",
    "This means that the volume and type of complaints received can reveal how well or poorly a transport system is functioning. For example, spikes in complaints often align with service cancellations, suggesting that unreliability directly affects user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "E (Example):\n",
    "In the dataset analysed, months with high driver vacancy rates also showed increased percentages of service cancellations. This likely contributes to more people reporting missed or delayed buses. If people cannot rely on the system, their trust and satisfaction decrease, which is reflected in complaint numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I (Interpret):\n",
    "I see this as confirmation of the hypothesis: \"Higher driver vacancies lead to lower reliability and more negative public response.\" However, to strengthen the analysis, more detailed complaint data (e.g. type, location, frequency) would help draw clearer connections between specific issues and public sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Based on current data, there is a clear relationship between staffing shortages and reliability issues, which likely contributes to higher complaint volumes. More granular complaint records or rider feedback would support deeper insights."

    "## Evaluate Project\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Requirements Outline \n",
    " \n",
    "The system successfully delivers on key requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading & Cleaning – Automatically imports the dataset, parses dates, and handles missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisation – Produces clear graphs comparing vacancies and cancellations over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering – Enables targeted analysis by region or month.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some advanced requirements remain unmet, such as real-time data updates, interactive dashboards, and integrating public complaint data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Peer Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Peer feedback on my project was consistently positive, recognising the accuracy of my calculations, the reliability of my dataset, the strength of my coding, and the depth of my research. Reviewers noted that the project demonstrated a high level of complexity and organisation, with datasets that effectively addressed the bus performance problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main suggestions for improvement were to refine the Markdown formatting for better readability, consider presenting datasets in a Markdown-friendly format for easier sharing, and increase dataset variety to allow for a more diverse representation of the issue. These are relatively minor adjustments, but implementing them could enhance the accessibility and richness of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the feedback confirms that my work meets a high standard and is well-suited to its purpose, with improvements mainly centred on presentation and variety rather than core accuracy or functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Modular coding approach (main.py + data_module.py) improved maintainability and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Late introduction of new features (e.g., complaints data) created scope creep and disrupted scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps: Use a more structured sprint cycle, approving feature additions only after milestone reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data & Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Validity: Data sourced from official transport reports is reliable in structure and format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: Likely accurate, though minor cancellations or unlogged disruptions may not appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeliness: Updated monthly, meaning real-time disruptions are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias: May underrepresent smaller or unofficial service issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security:\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Risks: Local storage without encryption, no user authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements: Encrypt datasets, introduce password-protected dashboards, and store files in secure, access-controlled locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UX & Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Current State: CLI interface works for technical users but lacks user-friendliness for the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a web-based dashboard (Streamlit/Dash) for ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add hover-over explanations and interactive filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide alternative text and high-contrast colour palettes for accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The system meets most of the core functional requirements and provides accurate, valid transport performance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "However incorporating better visual presentation, accessibility, data security and the integration of additional datasets would enhance its usefullness. The peer feedback given to me helps me refine will be helpful in the long run. \n"
